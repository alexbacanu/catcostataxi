## 1. Introduction

## 3. The personal data that we collect

3.1 In this Section 3 we have set out the general categories of personal data that we process and, in the case of personal data that we did not obtain directly from you, information about the source and specific categories of that data.

3.2 We may process data enabling us to get in touch with you ("contact data"). The contact data may include your name, email address, telephone number, postal address and/or social media account identifiers. The source of the contact data is you and/or your employer.

3.3 We may process information contained in or relating to any communication that you send to us or that we send to you ("communication data"). The communication data may include the communication content and metadata associated with the communication. Our website will generate the metadata associated with communications made using the website contact forms.

3.4 We may process data about your use of our website and services ("usage data").

(a) We use Vercel Analytics to collect certain information about the use of our website, including page views, network speed, browser type, device type, device operating system, country, web vitals, and server-received event time. This information is collected anonymously and does not allow us to identify individual users or reconstruct browsing sessions across pages. Vercel Analytics does not collect or store any information that would enable us to identify a user. The data points collected by Vercel Analytics are used for the sole purpose of optimizing the performance of our website. By using our website, you consent to the collection and processing of your data as described in this privacy policy.

For more information about Vercel Analytics and their data privacy policies, please visit the following links: <span className="text-amber-500">[Vercel's Privacy Policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy)</span> and <span className="text-amber-500">[Vercel's Terms of Use](https://vercel.com/legal/terms)</span>.

(b) We use the Google Maps API on our website to provide location-based services. The Google Maps API may collect certain information about website or mobile app visitors, including their device's IP address, precise location data if location services are enabled, and information about their interactions with the service, such as search queries and directions requested. The data collected will be forwarded to Google.

For more information about Google's privacy policy and terms of use, please visit the following links: <span className="text-amber-500">[Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)</span> and <span className="text-amber-500">[Google's Terms of Use](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms)</span>.

(c) We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on our website. This service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI"). hCaptcha is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled. For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the "invisible mode" may take place completely in the background. Website or app visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place if the user is not shown a challenge. Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. IMI acts as a "data processor" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a "service provider" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
