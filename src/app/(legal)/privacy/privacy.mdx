## hCaptcha

We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on our website. This service is provided by Intuition Machines,
Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI"). hCaptcha is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a
login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior
of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the
website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled. For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates
various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the
user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the "invisible mode" may take
place completely in the background. Website or app visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place if the
user is not shown a challenge. Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator
has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. IMI acts as a "data processor"
acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a "service provider" for the purposes of the California
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
